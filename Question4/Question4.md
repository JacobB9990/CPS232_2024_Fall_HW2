4. **(25 pts)** Given a sorted list of `n` numbers in ascending order, search for a number `i << n` (i.e `i` is much smaller than `n`). Please design an algorithm that is more efficient than binary search in this case in terms of running time (i.e., the running time of the desired algorithm should be better than `O(log n)`).

# **Answer**

**Yes**, there exists an algorithm that is more efficient than binary search for searching a number `i` in a sorted list of `n` numbers when i≪n so the target is closer to the start of the list. In this scenario, **Exponential Search** is an optimal approach, using the fact that the target value is close to the beginning of the list.

To implement **Exponential Search**, we take advantage of the position of `i` by exponentially increasing the index we search until we find an interval that is likely to contain the target. This approach is efficient because it avoids having to search the entire list as binary search would, instead focusing on a small portion of the list where the target is likely to be located.

The search starts by checking the first element of the array. If the target is not found there, the algorithm proceeds by examining indices that increase exponentially (1, 2, 4, 8, etc.). Once an index is found that is greater than the target or exceeds the array's bounds, we narrow our search to a small range and perform a **binary search** within that range. This strategy minimizes the number of elements that need to be examined, making it particularly efficient when `i` is much smaller than `n`.

By focusing on a small initial segment of the list, **Exponential Search** achieves a **running time of O(log⁡i)**, which is better than the O(log⁡n) time complexity of binary search when i≪n. This improvement is only useful in cases where the target is close to the start of the list, as the search completes after examining only a few elements, whereas binary search would examine more.
