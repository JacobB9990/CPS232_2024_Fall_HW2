1. **(25 pts)** We have learned about queues. There are two pointers for a queue: one is `head`, and the other is `tail`. When a new element is enqueued, this element will be placed at the position pointed to by the `tail`, and then the `tail` moves forward to point to the next vacancy. Conversely, dequeuing will pop the element pointed to by the `head`, and then the `head` moves forward to point to the next element.

   **There is a critical issue in such queues:** when an element is dequeued, the space previously occupied by this element cannot be reused for new elements. In array-based queues, this issue occurs literally as stated. In linked-list-based queues, frequently freeing memory for dequeued elements and allocating memory for enqueued elements may lead to memory issues, though it may mitigate the stated issue. To solve this issue neatly, Fanchao is looking for a new queue-like data structure that can reuse the space of dequeued elements and does not frequently free or allocate memory. **Please implement a new data structure, justify why it works, and analyze the running time of each operation.**
